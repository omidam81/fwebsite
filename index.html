    <p>Besponsa is a cancer medicine used to treat a type of blood cancer which affects B cells (a type of white blood
        cells) called B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Besponsa is used on its own in adults whose
        cancer has come back or did not respond to previous treatment.
    </p>

    <p>Besponsa is only used in patients with ‘CD22-positive B-cell precursor ALL’. This means that patients’ have a
        particular protein (CD22) on the surface of their white blood cells. In patients who have a type of chromosome
        known as Philadelphia-chromosome, treatment with a cancer medicine called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor should
        have been tried before starting Besponsa.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because the number of patients with B-cell precursor ALL is low, the disease is considered ‘rare’, and Besponsa
        was designated an ‘orphan medicine’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 7 June 2013.
    </p>

    <p>
        Besponsa contains the active substance inotuzumab ozogamicin.

    <p>
        How is BESPONSA different from chemotherapy?
    </p>
    <p>
        BESPONSA is a type of medicine called an antibody-drug conjugate. BESPONSA is designed to find and attach to a
        specific protein, called CD22, found on leukemia cells
    </p>

    <p>
        Once BESPONSA attaches to the CD22 protein, it enters the cell to deliver the drug, causing cell death
    </p>
    <p>
        By specifically targeting CD22, BESPONSA may offer different benefits and tolerability than chemotherapy
